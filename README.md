Missing value imputation (median strategy)
Feature scaling for numerical variables
One-hot encoding for categorical variables
**Stratified Sampling**
Stratified split based on income categories to ensure balanced training and test sets.
**Modeling**
Random Forest Regression with hyperparameter tuning
Cross-validation to evaluate model performance
**Performance Metric**
Achieved cross-validated RMSE of ~$49K
**Automation**
Full pipeline and trained model saved with joblib for reproducibility
